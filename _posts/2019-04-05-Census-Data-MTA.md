title: Week 1 Project - MTA Turnstile Data
---

First week's of METIS bootcamp came to an end.  Tasked with the project to use the MTA turnstile data to
help WTWY, Woman Tech Woman Yes, optimize their street teams to get the most of email signups for their
annual OMGYN Gala.

Being honest it was an daunting task for me at first, however, I was very fortunate to work in a team of
4 talented and patient individuals.

Mission: Come up with additional data resources that will help the WTWY achieve its conversion goals
